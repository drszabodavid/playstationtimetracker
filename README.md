# PlayStation Time Tracker
A web application to track how much time you sent on gaming.

## Check out the app on Heroku

Please enable CORS to use the search function of the app.
I recommend the Moesif CORS extension for Chrome.

## What is this
This is a demo project I made to get familiar with React, frondend development and the usage of APIs.

## How to use
On the homepage the user gets the trending games with the estimated time it takes to finish them. 
If he/she wants the game can be added to the user's game list.
